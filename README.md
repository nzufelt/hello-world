# hello-world
This is a test repo for me to learn the ropes.

My name is Nicholas Zufelt, and I'm currenttly (as of 10 Jan 2015) a researcher at Imperial College London.  I've picked back up on starting to use Github so that I can keep all my code in sync between my computers, and (eventually) share things I write with the world.
